Instructions to setup a Jenkins server
==================

This README describes the manual process to start a Jenkins server.

[**Scripts**](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project/crosscat/blob/master/install_scripts/VM_install/README.md#installing-jenkins) have since been generated to mostly automate the process.

-----

* Boot up a new starcluster instance with crosscat plugin. Preferably use on-demand m1.small to save money (needs to be on-demand so CI works).

* Ssh in as root.  **All the rest of the commands in this section (Instructions to setup a Jenkins server) will be run as root**

* Follow the directions here: http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable/, or execute the commands below:

        wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo echo "deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable binary/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y jenkins
        sudo apt-get update

* Open port 8080 for http (by default, it's not open!! You can do this by editing your ec2 security group).
  * go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
  * On the left, under NETWORK & SECURITY, click 'Security Groups'
  * select the security group for the cluster you've created
  * select the 'Inbound' tab
  * On 'Create a new rule' drop-down, select 'Custom TCP rule'
  * add '8080' to the text box labelled 'Port range'
  * click the 'Add Rule' button
  * click the 'Apply Rule Changes' button

* Access the Jenkins web interface at \<EC2-HOSTNAME\>:8080
  * you can determine your EC2-HOSTNAME with 'starcluster listclusters' from the machine you spun up the cluster
* click 'New Job' at the top left
* add 'PredictiveDB' to the text box labelled 'Job name'
* click the 'Build a free-style software project' radio button
* click the 'OK' button, a new window will open up to \<EC2-HOSTNAME\>:8080/job/PredictiveDB/configure
   * Under the 'Build' section: 
      * Click 'Add build step'
      * select 'Execute shell' from the drop down
      * add 'bash jenkins_script.sh' to the text box labelled 'Command'
        * a branch named \<BRANCH_NAME\> can be tested by appending '-b \<BRANCH_NAME\>'
   * Under the 'Post-build Actions' section:
      * Click 'Add post-build action'
      * select 'Archive the artifacts' from the drop down
      * add '**/*.*' to the text box labelled 'Files to archive'
      * Click 'Add post-build action'
      * select 'Publish JUnit test result report' from the drop down
      * add '**/nosetests.xml' to the text box labelled 'Test report XMLs'
      * Click 'Add post-build action'
      * select 'Email Notification' from the drop down
      * add 'preddb-dev@mit.edu' to the text box labelled 'Recipients'
   * Click 'Save' (at the bottom) to save your configuration.

* Configure email.

  * Go to \<EC2-HOSTNAME\>:8080/configure. Fill out the forms under the 'E-mail Notification' section
  * To use your own gmail account (only works with 2-factor authentication):
       * Sender E-mail Address: your address FIXME: is this 'System Admin e-mail address' under Jenkins Location?
       * SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
       * Click "Advanced"
       * Check 'Use SMTP Authentication'
       * User Name: your gmail username
       * Password: your gmail password (application-specific if you use 2-factor authentication)
       * Check 'Use SSL'
       * add '465' to the text box labelled 'SMTP Port'
  * To do this in a smarter way (recommended): set up a different mail server and enter its information.
     
* Hit "Build Now." It will fail but it will create the workspace directory.

* Put the jenkins script (jenkins_script.sh) in /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PredictiveDB. The easiest way is to do this:

        cp /home/sgeadmin/crosscat/jenkins_script.sh /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PredictiveDB/
        chown -R jenkins:nogroup /var/lib/jenkins
        chmod 777 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PredictiveDB
        chmod 777 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PredictiveDB/jenkins_script.sh

* Enable ssh login to the machine.

        perl -pi.bak -e 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        service ssh reload

  Change the jenkins user password: 

        passwd jenkins

  Make sure everything in /var/lib/jenkins is owned by jenkins user
  
        chown -R jenkins /var/lib/jenkins

  Make it easier for all users to access the db
        
        perl -i.bak -pe 's/peer/trust/' /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
        /etc/init.d/postgresql reload

  Build again. It should **fail**!  This build will take a while because the python packages are being installed in the virtualenv.

  Kill the server scripts so jenkins can start them up

        pkill -f python\.\*server_jsonrpc.py
        
  Install hcluster, which requires manual intervention and must occur after virtualenv setup (per commented part of requirements.txt)
  
        su jenkins
        source ~/.bashrc
        workon crosscat
        pip install --download ./ hcluster==0.2.0
        tar xvfz hcluster-0.2.0.tar.gz 
        cd hcluster-0.2.0
        python setup.py install
        # MANUAL: choose option 2

  Make sure to use matplotlib\'s headless backend.  **su jenkins** should still be in effect

        mkdir -p ~/.matplotlib
        echo backend: Agg > ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc

* Build again. It should work!
  * It works this time but not last time because the last build modifies .bashrc but doesn't read the changes into the environment

#Setting up Git Commit Hook

* Install Github plugin. Enter the URL for the repository, and ensure that the jenkins users' ssh keys are added on github.

* On Github, click on the repository settings, and add a post-receive hook. Click the github plugin page, and add the url for the jenkins server, appended with "/github-webhook/".

#Troubleshooting

* You may need to edit the matplotlib backend. To do this:

        python> import matplotlib
        python> matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()
        # Will print out a file location. Use vim/emacs/nano to edit that file, and change "backend" to "Agg".

* If it isn't already installed, install hcluster as follows (as user jenkins):

        jenkins> sgeadmin >workon crosscat
        jenkins> pip install hcluster (once downloaded, cancel - it will fail eventually).
        jenkins> cd /home/sgeadmin/.virtualenvs/crosscat/build/hcluster
        jenkins> python setup.py install
        jenkins> choose option 2

* Run table_setup, if you haven't already. (This shouldn't be necessary, but maybe it's worth a try?)

        root> su sgeadmin
        sgeadmin> psql -f /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/PredictiveDB/crosscat/table_setup.sql


#TODO/Needed features: 

* Using ssh keys instead of plaintext password in source (probcomp-reserve's password)

* Integration with Git plugin
